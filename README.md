Energy Consumption Prediction using Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)Project Overview
This project builds a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict energy consumption based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance. The model helps in optimizing energy usage and forecasting demand, which is crucial for smart grid management.
