#Energy Consumption Prediction using Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)

Project Overview
This project builds a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict energy consumption based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar irradiance. The model helps in optimizing energy usage and forecasting demand, which is crucial for smart grid management.

🚀 Features
* Data Preprocessing using Pandas & Scikit-learn
* Feature Scaling & Train-Test Split
* Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) using TensorFlow/Keras
* Model Evaluation & Visualization

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* NumPy & Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib for Visualization

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains environmental parameters that influence energy consumption, extracted from a structured Excel file.
